                  "name": "Windows in bedrooms and living areas are required to either be doubled glazed or have effective curtains or blinds installed.",
                  "descr": "Visually inspect any windows in the lounge (including open plan lounge\/dining areas) and bedrooms where the sill is below 2 metres above floor level (i.e. high level and clerestory windows are excluded). \nIf the windows are not double or secondary glazed (with an R value of at least 0.26), then curtains or blinds must be present with the following features: \n- Either a single layer of heavy weight, non-translucent material or lighter weight material with a thermal backing.\n- Cover at least 100% of the glazed area of the window.\n- Able to be easily opened and closed.\nCurtains or blinds are not required in the following locations: \n- Bathrooms\n- Kitchens\n- Entrance areas\n- High level (clerestory) windows\n- Skylights\n\nVenetian or slat blinds can be deemed to comply if they are in good working condition. \n\nNotes\nFor the purpose of a warrant, curtains on a working track or blinds (such as Roman-style blinds) should be at least 100% of the size of the glazed area. However, for improved performance, the following is recommended: \n- The minimum length is at least 200 mm below the bottom of the window frame.\n- Curtains should be at least 2 times as wide as the window so as to not fit completely flat and taut across the window.\n\nVenetian and slat blinds are deemed compliant for the purposes of a warrant because they will help contribute to privacy and can also reduce overheating. It should be recognised however that their thermal performance for heat retention is negligible. \nTranslucent material such as netting does not comply. \nMaterial pinned or secured in a manner other than a work track and which doesn\u2019t allow for the curtain to be easily opened and closed, does not comply."
